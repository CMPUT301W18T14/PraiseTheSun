 * Created by spack on 2018-02-23.
 * NotificationHandler deals with the creation of objects of the Notification Type. essentially
 * A middle man to communicate with the Factories.
 *
 * Currently I am using Users as parameters, I can change this to UserIDs pretty easily if we think
 * thats a good idea, I just was not sure the best way to integrate that with the data manager so
 * I kept it simple.
