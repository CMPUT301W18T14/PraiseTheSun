/**
 * Created by spack on 2018-02-23.
 * Anytime something happens to a Task i.e a status change or a bid is made a called will be made to
 * Create a notification object, this way, we will always have a Task object to pass into the
 * notifications class in order to get necessary info. The body of the notification will change
 * depending on the status of the task. These notifications get auto stored to the respective user,
 * Im not sure if this will work with online connectivity, its something to discuss on monday. I was
 * thinking about something like facebook where on the home page UI there is a little icon indicating,
 * unread notifications that when clicked on expands into a listview of notifications. I am
 * also unsure exactly how the rating notification will work.
