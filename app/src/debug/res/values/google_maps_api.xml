    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=B4:BB:6E:92:B5:71:7D:78:66:3C:6D:1A:8D:01:D8:9F:F9:C8:7C:D4%3Bca.ualbert.cs.tasko

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    B4:BB:6E:92:B5:71:7D:78:66:3C:6D:1A:8D:01:D8:9F:F9:C8:7C:D4

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    B4:BB:6E:92:B5:71:7D:78:66:3C:6D:1A:8D:01:D8:9F:F9:C8:7C:D4

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
